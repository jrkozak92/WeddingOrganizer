#Installation
Simply download the files and store them in the same folder. 
Vue is initallized via CDN and does not need any installation itself.
Open the HTML file to see the app

#Purpose
This was my first foray into Vue, and with a wedding comming up, it seemed the logical choice for a practice application.
I built this before I had any knowledge about how to implement a backend for persistent data, so it never made it past single session data, but I would like to go back and finish building out my vision for the application someday.

#Future Features/Continued Development
I'm currently focusing my time on my portfolio website, but once that is up and running, I'd like to come back to this and finish building out the concept,
including the Details and Guests sections, as well as a vendors area with info cards per vendor, added and managed by the user. Maybe even a way to compare and contrast competing vendors, and designate top choices/reordering of cards/etc.
